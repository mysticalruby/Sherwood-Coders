  <h3>A weekly update about random nerd related stuff</h3>
  <h3>TODAY'S TOPIC:THE 4TH DIMENSION!</h3></Marquee>
  <p>What is the fourth dimension? It's TIME! Yes and we are actually 4 dimensional because we all exist at a point in time! BUT! time may not be as you think BECAUSE we consider time as Earth's position on it's orbital path and it's rotation. SO what we know about the 4th dimension is not much.</p>
  <marquee><h1>NOTICE! POSSIBLE BREAKTHROUGH! CLAY MAY BE THE ANSWER!</h1></marquee>
  <p>YES! because on a two dimensional plane (paper) you can create an illusion of a 3 dimensional place. SO on a 3 dimensional plane (made out of clay) you MIGHT BE ABLE TO GLIMPSE INTO THE 4TH DIMENSION!</p>
